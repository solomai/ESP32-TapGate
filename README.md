# üîê TapGate v.1 ( prototype )

**TapGate** is a standalone extension module for gate automation systems that adds the ability to control gate via a smartphone application.

### Goal
Develop a hardware - software system (IoT + mobile app) for remote control of standard electronic gate controllers.

### Device Interaction
A single IoT device can be controlled by multiple instances of the mobile app:

```bash
             / 1 mobile app 
 IoT (ESP32) - 2 mobile app
             \ n mobile app
```

### Prototype Scope
- Choose a technology stack for rapid development of working code.
- Design a communication protocol between devices (registration, connection, command transmission, state notifications).
- Develop software modules for communication over Bluetooth and over the Internet as reusable components (submodules) for future versions.


### Key Features

- **Local control via Bluetooth**  
  Control the gate automation system from a smartphone at short range, without requiring an internet connection.

- **Remote control via Wi-Fi/Internet**  
  Operate the system over the internet using MQTT (supports both sequred anonymous and authenticated access) when Bluetooth is not available.
  Supports anonymous MQTT servers when no external server is available.
  Encrypts and validates data sent over anonymous MQTT for added security.

- **Home Assistant integration**  
  Integration with Home Assistant is possible via a trusted MQTT broker, either over the internet or within a local network.

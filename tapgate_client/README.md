# TapGate Client Documentation

## Overview  
The TapGate Mobile Client is a cross-platform app built with .NET MAUI that lets you control your TapGate-enabled gate system from anywhere. It connects to the IoT device either locally via Bluetooth or remotely over the Internet, so you can open, close, and manage access with ease. The app automatically adjusts to the device’s security mode and provides a simple interface for setup, daily use, and administration - all from one place on your smartphones and computers running .NET.

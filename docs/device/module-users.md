The data model handled by the Users module:

```text
Users {
    name : string;     // displayed client name
    client_id : UID;   // client identify
    nonce : number;    // command counter, also message id ( see protocol.md )
    pub_pem : string;  // public RSA received from client
    allow_flags : bits // specify the enabled features
}
```
where:

**name** - Initially generated based on data received from the client during registration. After client authorization, the field may be edited to match the device name. Stored exclusively on the device. Used to improve client identification in the Users list.

**client_id** - Used in the communication protocol to identify the client. Generated by the device when the client is added and sent to the client. ( see protocol.md )

**nonce** - Used to filter out duplicates and for Anti-replay guard ( see protocol.md )

**pub_pem** - The stored client RSA public key obtained during registration. Used to decode messages from the client. ( see protocol.md )

**allow_flags** - Byte value used to specify the enabled features
```text
allow_flags : bits
    Bit 0 (LSB) : Allow usage of Bluetooth module
    Bit 1       : Allow usage of public MQTT module
    Bit 2..7    : Reserved for future use
```
